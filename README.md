# Word-Count
A simplified version of the Unix “wc” word count program.

• Process multiple files.

• Count the number of characters, words, and lines in each file.

• Keep track of the total number of characters, words, and lines in all files.

• Print the results for each file in “ASCIIbetical” order by file name.

• Print the total number of characters, words, and lines in all files.

The program accepts three command line flags that control what it counts: “-c”, “-w”, and “-l”. The flags indicate whether or not the program should count characters, words, and lines, respectively. Your program should support any combination of these flags. If no flags are specified, then nothing should be counted, but empty results for each file should still be printed.
